# Project 01 - Recreate the Google Homepage

## Overview

In this first mini project for the course we have been tasked with recreating the layout of the Google search homepage.

There won't be any true functionality outside of just linking elements to their proper locations, but that's okay as the purpose of this exercise is to become familiar with how to layout a page and style it look a certain way.

## Things to Know

Here are some things to know:

* The spacing for the navigation is a little off in some spots.
* My CSS is pretty cluttered and could definitely use some refactoring.
